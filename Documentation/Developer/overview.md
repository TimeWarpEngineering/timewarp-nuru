`reference` (What IS - the actual implementation)
`design` (What SHOULD be -goals & principles)
`roadmap` (What WILL be - planned changes)
`standards` (How we work)
`guides` (How to do things)

Ideally the `reference` section should align with the `design` but the reference section should be derived/inferred from source NOT from the design (AI AGENTS SHOULD NOT USE the Design to generate this)

And the design should NEVER be changed to accomodate the reference section.

The `Architect ` Mode should be the only one allowed to change the Design documents.

The `Reference Writer` Mode should NOT even read the `design`
