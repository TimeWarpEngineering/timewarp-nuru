So, I read the installation and use guide. Haven't tried it yet.

1. First thing I noticed is that AddRoute naming might be wrong. I expected that to be used for web only. Only after I continued to read the rest of the code did I understand the project use-case. I would name it something like AddCommany as that is what it is, and it works better in CLI world.

2. I would also introduce a way to handle errors. Maybe link it after the first method. Example .AddRoute(...).OnError(...). This will give more information when user inputs wrong data.

Other than that, seems like a really good way of handling CLI commands. Very easy to use.

## Feedback Summary

### Point 1: Naming Convention
- **Issue**: `AddRoute` naming is confusing for CLI context
- **Expectation**: Expected web-only usage
- **Suggestion**: Rename to `AddCommand` or similar
- **Reasoning**: Better alignment with CLI terminology

### Point 2: Error Handling
- **Issue**: No specific error handling mechanism
- **Suggestion**: Add `.OnError()` fluent API
- **Example**: `.AddRoute(...).OnError(...)`
- **Benefit**: Better user feedback for invalid input

### Overall Assessment
