# Consensus Resolution Framework
**TimeWarp.Nuru - Community Feedback Analysis**

## Process Overview

This workspace facilitates a structured consensus-building process between AI reviewers to resolve the feedback on TimeWarp.Nuru CLI framework regarding:
1. `Map` → `AddCommand` naming change
2. `.OnError()` fluent API implementation

## Participants
- **Grok (Roo)**: Current AI providing technical analysis
- **Claude**: Previous AI that provided feedback (to be simulated/represented)

## Resolution Process
Each participant gets **3 iterations** to present their position and respond to the other. The process follows this structure:

### Iteration Format
```
Iteration X - [Participant Name]
├── Position Statement
├── Technical Arguments
├── Counter-Arguments to Opponent
└── Proposed Resolution
```

### Consensus Criteria
- Both parties agree on technical merit assessment
- Clear implementation recommendations
- Justification for strategic decisions
- Timeline and priority recommendations

## Files in this Workspace
- `consensus-framework.md` - This document
- `grok-iteration-1.md` - Grok's first position
- `claude-iteration-1.md` - Claude's first position (to be created)
- Subsequent iteration files as discussion progresses
- `final-consensus.md` - Final agreed-upon resolution

## Ground Rules
1. Each iteration must directly address points raised in the previous iteration
2. Technical arguments must be backed by code analysis or architectural reasoning
3. Strategic considerations must balance user experience with framework design principles
4. All positions must consider backward compatibility implications
5. Final consensus must include specific, actionable recommendations
