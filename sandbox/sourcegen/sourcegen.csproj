    These are testable helpers that will eventually become part of the source generator.
    All types are public for unit testing.

  <!-- 
    Note: We copy the design-time model types into this project rather than reference
    timewarp-nuru-analyzers because:
    1. The model types are internal in the analyzers project
    2. We want to keep this sandbox isolated
    3. The types are simple records that are easy to copy
