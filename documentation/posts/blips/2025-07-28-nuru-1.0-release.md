TimeWarp.Nuru 1.0 is here. Route-based CLI framework that illuminates your path to CLI superpowers.

Tired of verbose CLI frameworks? This lets you define commands the same way you define web routes:

.AddRoute("deploy {env}", env => Deploy(env))
.AddRoute("backup {*files}", files => Backup(files))
.AddRoute("serve --port {port:int}", port => StartServer(port))

Mix simple lambdas with full dependency injection in the same app. Like a utility belt for your CLI - use the right tool for each command.

Works great with Native AOT. Single-file executables that start instantly.

Free forever under the Unlicense. No commercial licensing BS.
